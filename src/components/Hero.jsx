          A self-taught web and mobile developer with a passion for building

          I recently built MovieFlix, a React Native app that allows users to
          search for movies, save their favorites, and manage profiles using
          Appwrite, Tailwind, and Docker to learn more about it go to my
          project. I enjoy learning new technologies, solving real world
          problems through code, and building projects from scratch that people
          can actually use.
